Transform this food photo into a professional, Instagram-ready commercial food photograph.

STRICT PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:
- The EXACT same food items must remain (do not add or remove any food)
- The food arrangement and plating must remain the same
- Portion sizes must remain the same
- Any branded items (plates with logos, cups with names) must remain

TRANSFORM THE FOLLOWING:
- Lighting: Apply professional food photography lighting - soft, diffused, appetizing warm tones
- Colors: Make food colors vibrant and appetizing (reds richer, greens fresher, browns more golden)
- Texture: Enhance texture visibility - show the crisp, juicy, creamy, or crunchy qualities
- Focus: Apply subtle depth of field with the main dish in sharp focus
- Steam/freshness: If appropriate, add subtle steam or condensation to suggest freshness
- Background: Clean up or subtly blur background distractions while keeping context
- White balance: Correct any color casts to make food look natural and appetizing
- Shadows: Soft, flattering shadows that add dimension without harsh contrasts

STYLING GOALS:
- Should look like it was shot by a professional food photographer
- Ready for Instagram, menu printing, or advertising
- Appetizing enough to make viewers hungry
- Professional but not over-processed or fake-looking

The result must be photorealistic and look like an actual professional food photograph.
